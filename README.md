# Using-ANN-to-find-Customer-Attrition-in-a-bank
Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company, also known as customer-attrition. It is also referred to as loss of clients or customers. 9000 customer information of a bank is given. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on the dataset is built such that it predicted correctly which of 1,000 customers the bank is going to lose. The ANN model is build from scratch without using any existing Deep Learning libraries writing training algorithms and loss functions for the ANN model.
You are given  sensitive  information of 9,000 of an European Bank, EBQ. Your task is to build anArtificial Neural Network (ANN) based on the dataset such that later the ANN model can predictcorrectly which of the 1,000 customers (in a separate unlabeled judge set) the bank is going to lose.This predictive analysis is vital for the EBQ bank to revise their business strategy towards customerretention. What do you think?Anyway, you are recruited by the bank to do the analysis. And, the head of the bank only trusts heads,i.e., brains.... I mean neural networks for making any decisions. And luckily you were in Dr. B’s classand know something(?) about the ANN that you could successfully convince the head of the bankduring the interview that the answer to life, the universe, and everything is the artificial neural network,“and not the number 42”.  He loved your answer. He put a lot of faith in you. Now, can you solve hisproblem?
