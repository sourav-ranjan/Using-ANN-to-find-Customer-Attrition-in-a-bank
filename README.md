# Using-ANN-to-find-Customer-Attrition-in-a-bank
Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company, also known as customer-attrition. It is also referred to as loss of clients or customers. 9000 customer information of a bank is given. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based on the dataset is built such that it predicted correctly which of 1,000 customers the bank is going to lose. The ANN model is build from scratch without using any existing Deep Learning libraries writing training algorithms and loss functions for the ANN model.

#Output of the program:

A CSV file (judge-pred.csv) containing the predicted labels (by your best performing ArtificialNeural Network in terms of accuracy) of the 1000 customers in exact same order of the judgeset. Please follow the format below:CustomerID,Exited12345,134567,0
